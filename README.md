Hello, this project is an attempt to design a website for a hospital, based off of my own work in
another class. The website has been design for both desktop, and mobile. You can view the mobile
styling by; 'Inspecting' the page -> 'Dimensions: iPhone 14 Pro Max'. A quick side-note, I decided
to leave in the images for the statistics page on mobile. I think it works better than boring plain text.

## THE PROCESS & CHALLENGES
I think the entire process for creating a website using the Bootstrap framework was overall a lot less stressful,
and enjoyable (in terms of the learning process) than starting from scratch. Although my website isn't even near perfect, I enjoyed
having a central place to look for information and be able to reference to it to obtain a better understanding of how things worked within
Bootstrap. There is still a lot to learn, but having foundational things already set up for you really helped kickstart the project and get
a decent foot in the door first, before even worrying about style. Regardless of how awesome Bootstrap is, that doesn't mean it didn't present
me with any challenges though. If I had to think of 1 challenge I faced that really got me confused (and I sort of avoided) I would probably have to say it was editing the 
existing style of Bootstrap using CSS. It is simple to redesign it using the CSS code we have already been taught but I am referring more to actually efficiently styling
the Bootstrap elements using all the pre-existing things in Bootstrap such as 'var's, !important, and referencing the pre-existing classes in CSS (for example .navbar-toggler)
I overcame most of these issues by searching up on the internet if people had similar issues, however I will admit I avoided most of the proper styling with bootstrap and just
targeted classes the easy way like we have before. One last thought that I just wanted to mention was that for whatever reason (I tried again and again to figure out why) the 
hamburger menu refuses to open on the mobile 'statistics' page. I have no idea why this is!

## WHAT I HAVE LEARNED
If I had to take away anything from this experience I think it would be related to time management. My website is decent, but not perfect.. I struggle with most things
responsive, and even though I had Bootstrap to help me set up the structure a lot quicker, I was still taking time to try to perfect things as best I could. I learned that
even though Bootstrap seems to do most of the work itself, that doesn't mean that there isn't much more work to be done manually, to actual make the website the way YOU want it.
